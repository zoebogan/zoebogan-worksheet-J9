1. A design pattern, template, is a concept that provides a conceptual solution to a problem. A java library contains precise functionality that is readily available and already has been implicitly tested and debugged which may have solved a problem already.

2. ```java
   public class DBSingleton {
       private static DBSingleton file;
       private static Connection connection;
   
       private DBSingleton() {
           connection = new Connection("username", "12345". "120.5.3.2");
        }
        public static DBSingleton getInstance() {
            if (connection == null) {
                connection = new DBSingleton();
            }

           return connection;
        }
    }
```

3. ```java
   public class AnimalFactory {
      public static Animal getAnimal(String option, String name, int weight){
         switch(option) {
            case "mammal":
               return new Mammal(name, weight);
            case "bird":
               return new Bird(name, weight);
         }
         return null;
      }
   }
```

4. ```java
   public class MammalAdapter extends Fish {
         private Mammal mammal;
        //set up in ctor

        public static void feed(String food, int weight) {
          return mammal.feed(food, weight, "antibiotics");
        }
        public static void clean(String cleaningProduct) {
          return mammal.clean();
        }
      }
   ```
   
5. Without a Bridge design it can be unmaintainable and duplicate code can occur. The benefit of the Bridge design is that it allows for an engineer to write maintainable software, good OOP separation and provides the space to add additional classes.
